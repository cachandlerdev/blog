# Main Points

- I've worked on a number of game jam entries both as a solo developer and working in a team, and have no issue with taking on leadership roles if necessary.

- I have experience with Unreal Engine using both Blueprints and C++ code.
I know there are other engines out there like Unity and Godot, but so far I've mainly stuck with Unreal because I like their business model and it's typically faster to make a game with a technology you know, as opposed to one you would have to learn first.

- As a CSE student, I tend to be more interested in the programming side of game development as opposed to the artistic part, but I can make fairly decent UI mockups in Figma or 3D models of inanimate objects like swords or axes if need be ([see my ArtStation profile](https://www.artstation.com/cachandler654)).

## Game Jam Entries

Here are some of the main games I've worked on at this point in time. 
Of course, I've worked on others, but they were either too small or not far along enough to be worth mentioning.

### Sam'n Slime

[Link to Itch.io](https://aejjee.itch.io/samnslime) - *A tower defense game about destroying Sam's plants.*

This was a game jam entry I made for the GMTK Game Jam 2023 in collaboration with one other programmer and two artists.
As a 2D game that sought to "reverse" the Plants vs. Zombies idea about defending a house against enemies, the player gets to command an army of minions and attack Sam's base in a wave-based system that incorporates humor and some strategic elements.

### Two Cubes

[Link to Itch.io](https://cachandlerdev.itch.io/two-cubes) - *A puzzle game where the player controls two cubes that must work together.*

This was my first game jam entry, but I would say it holds up fairly well for a solo project thrown together in the span of 48 hours.
In this visually stunning 3D game---thanks to Unreal's superb graphics---the player must control two separate cubes that must collaborate to interact with buttons, dodge enemies, jump over deadly carpets and more to complete a number of puzzle based levels.
Virtually everything except the music was made by me.

### Not Your Average Dice Roller

[Link to Itch.io](https://slightlybonkers.itch.io/not-your-average-dice-roller) - *A first person shooter in which the player's objective is to survive and reach the door in each level.*

In this first person shooter, the player has to slip past a horde of enemies and try to make it to the end of each level alive. 
This game jam entry was made in collaboration with a few other people, but unfortunately, I must admit that out of all of the projects I've worked on so far, this one probably suffered most from overscoping and time constraints.
In spite of that, I have left it on here because the systems and custom assets that were created within the given 48 hours were fairly impressive nonetheless.

### Darkrealm

[Link to Itch.io](https://spacewhale-studios.itch.io/darkrealm) - *An open world role playing game.*

This was one of the first games I ended up working on a few years back.
The quick summary is that after getting a bit of experience with Unreal under my belt, I decided in my infinite wisdom to make the next Skyrim as a solo developer.
After working on it for a few months and getting most of the core systems implemented, I got help from the instructor of my class on creating an actual 3D world for the game, since I had mainly focused on the mechanics part and not on actually using them to make something playable.
Ultimately, the project ended up failing due to technical debt, but it was an excellent learning project overall, as I learned how to first implement and then integrate numerous RPG systems such as inventory, spells, attacks, AI, and more.

### Escape from the Labyrinth

[Link to Youtube Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ8oBA7tOgQ) - *A role playing game set in a maze.*

This was the very first video game I made in Unreal Engine a few years back.
Most of the assets came from a YouTube tutorial series I was following, and I'll be the first to admit that it isn't exactly my best work, but I'd argue that it holds up pretty well for a first entry.
The player can either play as a knight or a sorceress, and has to battle enemies while finding his way out of a giant maze.
